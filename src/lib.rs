//!
//! A Rust library for detecting and parsing data about games installed on the system. Currently
//! only supports Linux.
//!
//! # Description
//!
//! This is a Rust library intended to be used for programs which need information on currently
//! installed games, such as a games launcher, or mod manager. It can provide information such as
//! what games are installed across multiple launchers (such as Steam and Heroic Games Launcher),
//! where those games are installed, what command will launch them, and more.
//!
//! # Quick start
//!
//! Install with:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo add lib_game_detector
//! ```
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```rust
//! use lib_game_detector::{data::SupportedLaunchers, get_detector};
//!
//! let detector = get_detector();
//! let detected_launchers = detector.get_detected_launchers();
//! let all_games = detector.get_all_detected_games();
//! let all_games_by_launcher = detector.get_all_detected_games_per_launcher();
//! let all_games_from_steam = detector.get_all_detected_games_from_specific_launcher(SupportedLaunchers::Steam);
//! ```
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! - See [rofi-games](https://github.com/Rolv-Apneseth/rofi-games) for an example which uses this library to find games and their box art to use for displaying in a launcher
//! - Check the [examples folder](https://github.com/Rolv-Apneseth/lib_game_detector/tree/main/examples)
//!
//! # Currently supported game sources
//!
//! - Steam
//!   - Non-Steam games added as shortcuts are also supported. Just make sure to launch newly added
//!     shortcuts through Steam at at least once for them to be detected correctly (some files need
//!     to be generated).
//! - Heroic Games Launcher (Legendary, Nile, GOG, and manually added games)
//! - Lutris
//! - Bottles
//!   - Only lists entries included in the Library
//! - Modded Minecraft (Prism Launcher, ATLauncher)
//!   - Titles are given as `Minecraft - {instance name}`

// TODO: use [macro_files](https://github.com/MathieuTricoire/macro_files) to reduce size of repo
// and more importantly to have clear definitions of expected file structures for each test. All
// the example game files will still need to be included so as to not clutter the code though.
